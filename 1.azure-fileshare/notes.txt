I got this error when i moved from nfs server setup to azurefile share

panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference [signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x18 pc=0xae824f]

and also there was continuation of this error pointing to golang issue, i was very much confused but my logic is everything was working prior and only changes i have made is pv file for azurefileshare
so i changed mount options in that file to match nfs server
